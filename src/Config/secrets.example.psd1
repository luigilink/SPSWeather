    # Each key (e.g. 'PROD-ADM') matches the CredentialKey of an environment config
    # (contoso-PROD.psd1). PasswordSecure must be a SecureString encrypted with the
    # current user's DPAPI key. Generate it ON THE TARGET SERVER, signed in as the
    # account that will run the scheduled task, with:
    #
    #   PS> Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt 'Password' | ConvertFrom-SecureString
    #
    # Paste the resulting string between the single quotes below. The encrypted value
    # can only be decrypted by the same user account on the same machine.
    #
    # Tip: running  .\SPSWeather.ps1 -Action Install -InstallAccount (Get-Credential) ...
    # AS that service account writes this entry for you automatically.
